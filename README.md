# TamagotchiP2Android

This is a reproduction of a P2 model of Bandai's 1997 tamagotchis <br/>
The code is pretty barbaric as I coded it almost entirely on my phone (didn't use Android Studio). <br/>
Also, I wasn't very good at Java when I started this project (back in 2020). I'm still getting the hang of it <br/>
There are a few final touches I need to bring, but you could entirely play with it.<br/>
There's an apk of the project in the bin directory ( https://github.com/LyesDemri/TamagotchiP2Android/blob/main/bin/MyTama.signed.apk ) if you wish to install it.<br/>
If you wish to look at the code in Android Studio, you'll have to set up a project and add the files manually, you'll have to know what you're doing.<br/>

To reset it, navigate through the icons using the A button until "Menu" appears underneath the shell of the Tamagotchi. Hit the B button and then you'll be able to select "Reset" using the A button. Then just hit the B button to reset.
